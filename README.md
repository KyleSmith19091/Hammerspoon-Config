# Window Manger Hammerspoon
This is a config file for an application called Hammerspoon[https://www.hammerspoon.org] 
which allows you to interact with applications, windows, menubar, execute OSA scripts
etc. 

# What have I used it for
I used the hammerspoon API as a way to write my own window manager. I wrote 
functions to move windows to fill half of the screen or a quarter of the screen.
Furthermore added functionality to launch applications from a hotkey.

I also used the hammerspoon API to customise my menubar to show the weather of my 
current location using curl and the wttr.in website.
